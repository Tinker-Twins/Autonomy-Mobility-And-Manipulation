SolidWorks --> URDF --> CoppeliaSim Workflow

Step 1: Export URDF from SolidWorks

1. Design individual parts in SolidWorks with the "Front" (XY) plane as the top-view plane for the part (this is very important)
2. Assemble the parts in SolidWorks with the "Front" (XY) plane as the top-view plane for the assembly (this is very important)
3. Create the following reference geometries for each joint:
	- "Axis" passing through the joint
	- "Coordinate Frame" attached to the origin of the joint (you may need to define a point at this location first)
4. If not already done, install the "SW2URDF" plugin (you may need to restart SolidWorks after installing the plugin)
5. Locate the plugin button "Export as URDF" either under the "File" menu (older versions of SW) or the "Tools" menu (newer versions of SW)
6. Configure the link hierarchy and assign appropriate joints. Reference the axes and origins for each joint defined in step 3.
7. Click "Preview and Export..." button to export the URDF file.

Step 2: Import URDF into CoppeliaSim

1. Click "Modules" --> "Importers" --> "URDF importer"
2. Browse to the exported ".urdf" file and select it
3. Once imported, make necessary changes to suit it to your CoppeliaSim scene.

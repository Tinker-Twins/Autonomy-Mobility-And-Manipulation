1.1. Launch CoppeliaSim
1.2. Launch MATLAB

2.1. In CoppeliaSim, double-click on the `new scene` script and add the following line at the begining:

	simRemoteApi.start(19999)

2.2. In MATLAB, browse to the directory where CoppeliaSim is installed (e.g. C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics)
2.3. Add the `CoppeliaSimEdu` folder to PATH by right-clicking it --> `Add to Path` --> `Selected Folders and Sub-Folders`

3.1. In MATLAB, browse to `C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics\CoppeliaSimEdu\programming\remoteApiBindings\matlab\matlab` and open `simpleTest.m`
3.2. In CoppeliaSim, RUN the simulation
3.3. In MATLAB, RUN the `simpleTest.m`; it should print something as follows:

	Program started
	Note: always make sure you use the corresponding remoteApi library
	(i.e. 32bit Matlab will not work with 64bit remoteApi, and vice-versa)
	Connected to remote API server
	Number of objects in the scene: 71
	Mouse position x: 1038
	Mouse position x: 1038
	Mouse position x: 1038
	Mouse position x: 1038
	Mouse position x: 1038
	Mouse position x: 1038
	.
	.
	.

NOTES:
1. Make sure CoppeliaSim simulation is running before running MATLAB script.
2. CoppeliaSim robots are configured to run certain child scripts, disable these since they interfere with MATLAB script.
